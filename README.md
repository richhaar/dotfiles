# Richard's dotfiles 

This repository is used to track dotfiles containing:

* zshell config with zprezto
* vim config
* emacs config
* git config


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/richhaar/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && install.sh

This will setup my dotfiles for the local machine.
If you decide to use these dotfiles make sure to have a look at the settings and change the gitconfig file
